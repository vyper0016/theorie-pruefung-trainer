data in folder "2" refers to the later version
app.js is kinda main
for other languages it looks in ext
see line 15693 in app.js

it appears the following companies get the same db: t24, adac, franzis, tplus (menu_adac_de.js)
they get the db once a year, hence why there are 2 folders named 1 and 2
the first is valid from 01/04 and the second from 01/10

-- db for questions breakdown --
class B: "6"

zusatzstoff class B questions have ",6," in their ['classes'] (count: 561)

total questions with an empty ['classes'] = 646 which is different than the 627 found on a website (https://www.fuehrerschein-bestehen.de/fuehrerscheintest/fragenkataloge.aspx)
other numbers however seem to correspond to the website

total questions(all classes): 1831 (checks out)

all questions have category ids, some have more than 1 (537)

mq_flag (1 or 0) (223, 1608): refers to mother questions which can slightly change in the main exam


it is 1 with all the questions with -M at the end and they all seem to have an image or a video


the basic key seems to correspond to the Grundstoff questions (625) which is still different than the 623 on the website


questions with a non-empty asw_hint_1: 76
                            2 and 3 however seem to be useless


"asw_index_1": 1,
"asw_index_2": 2,
"asw_index_3": 3, all seem to be redundant

-- Sets --
it appears that each class has 99 sets of questions

sets with class 6 all have 30 questions



--- setting it up ---
to automate :
    unzip the apk then 

1. get the following files (relative to \assets\www\data\1)
